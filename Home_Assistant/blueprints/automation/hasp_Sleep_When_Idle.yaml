    # Description

    Configure a HASP to sleep when idle after a defined number of seconds.  The screen will go dark, and the next time you
    touch the screen it will turn back on to be ready for use.

    The HASP stops accepting any input when sleeping, so items on the screen that change periodically will need a refresh.
    For example, if a clock is displayed, it won't update until the next minute elapses.  The "Force Refresh on Wake" option
    will push all updates to the HASP when it awakens.  This might make the screen refresh a few times when that happens.
