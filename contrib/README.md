Several users of HASP have found new ways to use, modify, and interact with HASP.  Here are some ideas people have put together and have been kind enough to share with the rest of us!

* **[openHAB Integration](openHAB)** @bkpsu has done loads of work to make HASP work with openHAB.
* **[zonko's Custom Pages for HASP](/zonko16/Custom-Pages-for-HASwitchplate)** @zonko16 has made some really great looking custom pages and automations for HASP.  These are great examples of how you can extend HASP to look and function in new ways.
* **[User-contributed 3D models](3D_Printable_Models)** @billchurch has made some additional 3D printable models for various use cases
